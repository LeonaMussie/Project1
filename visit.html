          <h3>Eritrea</h3>
          <p>The history of Eritrea, dating as far back as 6000 BC, is rich and filled with complexity. The origin of the name Eritrea is the word erythrean, Greek for “red” (in reference to the Red Sea).</p>
          <p>The strategic location it inhabits has not only been a source of enrichment but also the root of many of its tribulations. Eritrea’s geographical location made it a vital trading route, even during the first millennium BC.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="pre-history"> 
         <img src="images/kohain.png">
         <h3>Prehistory</h3>
         <p>Qohaito was a major ancient city in what is now the Debub region of Eritrea. It was a pre-Aksumite settlement that thrived during the Aksumite period.</p>
         <p>Qohaito, found on one of the plateaus of Eritrea, was just one of the thriving ancient trading cities.</p>

     <div class="history"> 
        <img src="images/fighters.png">
        <h3>Modern Eritrea</h3>
        <p>Modern-day Eritrea is defined by that struggle for independence. It was an all-encompassing armed struggle to liberate Eritrea and Eritreans from all of the ills of oppression, inequality, and poverty.</p>
        <p>The most dramatic and self-sacrificing epoch in all of Eritrea’s long and glorious history was the bloody War of Liberation, which concluded with its emancipation into statehood in 1991.</p>
       </div>
     <div class="pre-history">
      <img src="images/eritrean fighters.png">
      <h3>Independent Eritrea</h3>
      <p>In 1991, the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) captured the Eritrean capital, the ultimate prize—Asmara—bringing to an end the 30-year bitter struggle for liberation. On May 24, 1991, independence was achieved, in effect if not yet by law. At once, the newly formed Provisional Government of Eritrea (PGE) set out to reconstruct the country’s devastated infrastructure while building a rudimentary state apparatus to manage the transition to internationally recognized sovereignty. Eritrea formally gained its independence and sovereignty following an internationally monitored referendum in 1993.</p>

        <h3>Religion</h3>
        <p>There are two major religions in Eritrea, Christianity and Islam.The population of the high plateau (Asmara) is predominantly Christian, whereas that of the lowlands and the coast are predominantly Muslim.</p>
        <p>Both religious groups have managed to live together in harmony and in peace.</p>

          <h3>Coffee ceremony</h3>
          <p>One of the most recognizable parts of Eritrean culture is the coffee ceremony.Coffee is offered when visiting friends, during festivities, or as a daily staple of life. The coffee is brewed by first roasting the green coffee beans over hot coals in a brazier. Once the beans are roasted each participant is given an opportunity to sample the aromatic smoke by wafting it towards them.</p>
          <p>The coffee grounds are then put into a special vessel, called a jebena, and boiled. A jebena is usually made of clay and has a spherical base, a neck and pouring spout.</p>

         <h3>Cuisine</h3>
         <p>Typically, Eritrean cuisine consists of various stews (tsebhi) made from vegetables and meat, and served atop a large, flat sourdough bread called injera, tayta, "shuro", "alicha" and "hamly".</p>
         <p>In addition, Eritrean cuisine has a lot of Italian dishes from the Italian Eritrean cuisine introduced during Italian Eritrea. It is more common to find people eating the Italian Eritrean cuisine in the capital, Asmara</p>

         <h3>Massawa</h3>
         <p>Visiting Massawa, Eritrea.  Massawa rests on the coast of the Red Sea.</p>
         <p>Often regarded as the pearl of the Red Sea, Massawa is a coastal port city with significant historical importance throughout history.  It is home to the Sahaba Mosque, the first mosque in Africa, as well as Turkish and Egyptian architecture.</p>

        <img src="images/dahlakisland.png">
        <h3>Dahlak Islands</h3>
        <p>Some 200 of Eritrea’s islands belong to the Dahlak archipelago with a great opportunity for scuba diving and (pearl) fishing. Charter yachts are available for hire in Massawa.</p>
        <p>Only four islands are inhabited, with a small population who still maintain their traditional lifestyle of fishing and herding goats and camels. The isolated and uninhabited Dahlak Islands, and the rich feeding grounds which surround them, attract large numbers of nesting sea birds from all over the red sea.</p>

        <h3>Eritrea - UNESCO World Heritage Centre</h3>
        <p>Asmara is an exceptional example of early modernist urbanism at the beginning of the 20th century and its application in an African context. This bowling alley was built in the era in an art deco style.</p>
        <p>Famous among them is the Fiat Tiaglero building, a petrol station shaped as an aeroplane. Built in 1938, it now stands empty.
